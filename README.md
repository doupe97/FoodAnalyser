# FoodAnalyser

### Description ###
This project was implemented as part of my bachelor thesis and includes an iOS application.
The iOS app can be used to capture images of food and then calculate the volume of the food.
The Object Capture API integrated in macOS is used for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the food object.
The Python library <i>PyVista</i> is used on the server side for the volume calculation.

### Implemented functions ###
- Instruction view
- Taking pictures
- Handling multiple RESTful APIs
- Storing measurement results in CoreData
